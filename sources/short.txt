Post Operative Care
Postoperative Instructions
Apart from the specific instructions given to you depending on the type of surgery you have undergone, the basic general instructions that you should follow after your surgery are as follows:
* Take pain relieving and other medications as advised. Pain relieving medication should be taken with food. After the first 48 hours of surgery, take the pain medication only when needed.
* Apply ice packs regularly, 20 minutes at a time to control swelling. However, make sure that the ice bag does not leak into the dressing. Ice packs can be used liberally for the first 48 hours and even later, if required.
* Follow the specific restriction of activity, as advised.
* Keep the dressing clean and dry to promote wound healing.
* Begin physical therapy if prescribed. Exercises in the first week are usually aimed at regaining joint motion. Strengthening exercises are initiated later. Regular exercises are critical for a successful outcome.
* Eat a healthy diet and drink plenty of non-alcoholic and non-caffeinated drinks.
* Schedule your follow-up appointment with your doctor as advised.
Please consult your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:
* Increased drainage from the incision
* Increased redness around the operated area
* Increased swelling that does not decrease with ice and elevation
* Foul odor
* Fever greater than 101°F
* Coldness, numbness or blanched white or bluish color of the fingers or toes
* Sudden calf pain or shortness of breath
* Chest pain
